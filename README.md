# Supericium

Methodology, tools, and conventions for delivering Polymer based 
web components that can be used in composites without worrying 
about element naming collision for transitive dependencies.

## Development approach

In addition to advocating zero friction [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) based component reuse, 
supericium also encourages asset reuse (CSS, Images, Javascript, etc.) using your favorite set of 
development tools.

In order to minimize the learning associated with using 3rd party assets within your components, 
supericium provides and recommends the use of the [Supericium Standard Project Layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@supericium/pli) 
for projects that form the core building blocks of your component.
